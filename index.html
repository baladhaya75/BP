                <h3>Madam can i go with little bit english, you can't able to undersand my tamil</h3>
                <p>At 8.27am in the morning, Naa call pesitu phone vachana. Then I went for my birthday shopping and came back tired, so I slept. You give some Nosecuts --> dei phone ahh cu pannu daa like that.
                The next day, I had exams, and I was busy for 5 days. During this time,(My frd know about my nosecut and he do some korangu settai in favour of ava onakku vena da) -->friend took my phone and deactivated the ms_aesthetic_02 account, but I didn‚Äôt know that because I wasn‚Äôt using my phone during the exams. I follow a strict rule of not using my phone during exams, so I didn‚Äôt even check it.
                After my last exam, when I finally used my phone, I noticed that the ms_aesthetic_02, account was missing. I was shocked and start thinking . Apro naa oru valiyaa recover panna account ahh . When I checked your chat, it showed "Instagram user" !!!
                Padma, naa epti pannuva block la . that idiot did, and I‚Äôm saying sorry for that idiot.
                Yes, I am a short temper, but epdi la panna matta. I got really angry and scolded them for what they did.
                I used to share my feelings with them like I did with you, but they crossed the line. Unlike others, I can‚Äôt just move on and prefer options like Trisha illana Nayanthara.
                I never tortured you in the name of love. kadal la potta coin ahh thedurathum naa onta pesama irukathum onnu </p>
